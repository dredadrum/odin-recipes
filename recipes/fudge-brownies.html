        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>In a 3-quart saucepan over very low heat, melt butter and chocolate, stirring the mixture constantly. 
            Remove from heat, and stir sugar into the chocolate. Allow the mixture to cool slightly. 
            Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each, then stir in vanilla. Combine 
            flour and salt; stir into the chocolate mixture. Fold in walnuts. Spread the batter
